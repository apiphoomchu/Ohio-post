He has earned support through acts of kindness, leadership, and a planned charity concert for farm development. The election results will be announced in the fall.\n\n## RonaldForMayor : We're lovin' it\n\nThis summer is becoming one of the most heated in Ohio's history. Not because of the sun. But because of the major election's climax. Currently, the statue of Ronald Mcdonald from the McD's party is taking a massive lead against other candidates with a 69% approval rating. The increasing support is all thanks to the #RonaldForMayor Campaign, a campaign to provide food for the poor within Ohio. Ronald and his staff set out a stool in front of the town square every day, handing out succulent burgers to those who need them.\n\nCitizens within Ohio are giving the Ronald party praise for this wholesome event. Some people even opt to provide support by operating the grill, increasing the rate of burger production tenfold. Tanner Mcgilvroy, one of the cooks who assisted with the grilling, expressed his opinion on Ronald and his party. \"I used to distrust him. His solemn expression and make-believe promises always kept me suspicious of whether he would pull it off. However, once I saw Ronald cooking away, giving the poor something to eat, I knew that my deceptions misled me about who he is. I could not stand idly by anymore, so I pitched in to help him. On top of being kind, he is also a great leader, always keeping us on our toes. Without a doubt, Ronald has earned my vote.\" Not only were the volunteers impressed, but the citizens were also inspired by Ronald's generosity. Miss Abigail Federegy, a local of Ohio, shared her thoughts on the aspiring mayor. \"The dedication he demonstrated in that event showed us that he is willing to get his hands dirty for the sake of our happiness and well-being. No other politician I know would ever do that! Ronald has my support through and through.\"\n\nWith all the support that the McD's party is getting, we might certainly be entering an age of prosperity with Ronald in the lead. Currently, Ronald is planning a charity concert where all of the proceeds will go to the development of farms. He hopes that Ohio will have another option for generating revenue and meals that improve the public's health.\n\nRonald's good deeds have proven to us that he is capable of leading the state. If he keeps up the good conduct, perhaps we will receive good news regarding his position. But only time will tell. The election results will be up in the fall, so please keep your eyes and ears open. ","slug":"post-4"}]
